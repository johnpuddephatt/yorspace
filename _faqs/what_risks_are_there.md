title: Does investing carry risks?
---
Investments are at risk and people considering investing should read the business plan in full to i) understand these risks and ii) understand the strategies YorSpace have put in place to minimise them.
Only by doing will you be able to determine whether the investment is suitable for you.

The business plan is currently being finalised and will be published in advance of the share offer opening.
